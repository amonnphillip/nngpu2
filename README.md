# nngpu2
A small neural network written in C++ using Nvidia CUDA SDK for hardware acceleration. This example introduces a few more node types than the last, Fully connected, RELU and POOL. This program will train a neural network on two small 4x4x1 images and will output 1,0 or 0,1 based on the image fed into the input layer.

To compile and run the project you need Visual Studio 2015 and the Nvidia CUDA 8 SDK. Just compile and run.
